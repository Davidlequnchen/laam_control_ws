# Instructions
To build the workspace:
- delete build and devel folder:
   ```
   catkin clean
   ```
- navigate to __src/labjack_ros/dependency__ folder to check the instructions on installation of LabJack related dependent packages
- Build and Install USB Camera driver: http://wiki.ros.org/usb_cam
- navigate to workspace to build, __force to build with python3 instead of python2__
   ```
   catkin_make -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3
   ```

## Parameters Configurations
- USB camera number: in __camera_monitoring/launch__ folder, change the ```"/dev/video0"``` value in camera_monitoring.launch file, try ```"/dev/video1"``` or other value such as -1,2 to connect to your USB camera device
- to be updated
